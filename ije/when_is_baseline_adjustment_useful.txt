In epidemiology studies measuring the change in some variables, a common
approach to get causal effect is to use the baseline score of the variable
(whose change we are measuring) as the adjustment variable (along with others).
The paper takes an example of the effect of education on cognitive decline. The
two models compared are:

$$ (score_i2 - score_i1) ~ education + score_i1 $$

and

$$ (score_i2 - score_i1) ~ education $$

An analysis is done based on both these models using the AHEAD dataset to show
that the causal effects estimated by these two models are different. Hence, one
of them has to have some kind of bias in the estimate. The authors then try to
explain this bias in the first model using DAGs showing that doing the
adjustment on score_i1 leads to opening of a biasing path. The authors further
show couple of different possiblities that can happen because of baseline
adjustment.
